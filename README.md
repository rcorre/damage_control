Damage Control
===

Damage Control is a game similar to
[Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(video_game)).

# Give it a try!

## Pre-built
Just grab the most recent
[release](https://github.com/rcorre/damage_control/releases) for your platorm,
unpack it, and run the `damage_control` executable.

## Build it yourself
You will need a [D compiler](http://dlang.org/download.html) and
[dub](http://code.dlang.org) to compile the game,
[aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org/) to generate the images, and
[lmms](https://lmms.io/) to compile the music.

Running `make` should do the trick. This will invoke `dub` to compile the code,
`aseprite` to export `.ase` files to `.png`, and `lmms` to export `.mmpz` files
to `.ogg`.
